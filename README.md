This is a timer-based quiz application that stores high scores client-side

1. 
  Once the quiz begins via user input a function then pulls the questions from their respective object, meaning, the array within which they were created. 

2. 
  As the user progresses thru the quiz a right or wrong answer will change the timer in
  the top right corner. A correct response subtracting 0 from the timer and an incorrect response negating 15.

3. 
  Upon completion/failure of the quiz the user is then sent to a highscores page where they will be prompted to enter their initials that will be logged within the Window element of the browser. The user will also be free to repeat the quiz to attain a higher score. The starting page containsn a View Highscores link to view the Highscore page & previous user attempts assuming they did not clear them.
